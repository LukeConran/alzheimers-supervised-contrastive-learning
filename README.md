# Alzheimer's MRI Classification: CE vs. Supervised Contrastive Learning

3D brain MRI classification into **Alzheimer's Disease (AD)**, **Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI)**, and **Normal Cognition (NC)** using 3D ResNet backbones, comparing plain cross-entropy training against supervised contrastive pretraining. Runs on an HPC cluster via SLURM.

## Motivation: Why this repo looks the way it does

The original plan was **self-supervised contrastive learning** (SimCLR-style): pretrain a 3D ResNet encoder on a large pool of *unlabeled* MRI scans until it produced features that were easy to classify, then fine-tune a lightweight classifier on a much smaller labeled subset. The appeal was practical: because clinician-labeled MRI scans are expensive to produce, if a model could learn good representations from unlabeled scans first, the amount of labeled data (and clinician time) needed downstream would shrink substantially.

That plan ran into a structural problem: **ADNI, the dataset this project uses, is fully labeled.** There is no large unlabeled pool sitting alongside it, so every scan already has an AD / MCI / NC label. Self-supervised pretraining has nothing to offer when there's nothing unlabeled to pretrain on; the labeling-burden problem SimCLR was meant to solve doesn't exist within this dataset. (It would still be viable on a separate, mostly-unlabeled corpus like UK Biobank, but that's a different project.)

So the project pivoted to a question that ADNI's data actually supports: **given labels, can we use them more effectively than cross-entropy alone?** Instead of self-supervised pretraining, this repo uses **Supervised Contrastive Loss** ([Khosla et al., NeurIPS 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.11362)), which pulls embeddings of the same class together and pushs different classes apart, using the labels directly. This is also trained jointly with (or ahead of) the classification head. The research question thus became:

> **Does supervised contrastive learning improve classification performance over plain cross-entropy, given the exact same labeled dataset and backbone?**

## Results

Final-epoch metrics from `results/{backbone}/{mode}/metrics.json` (50 epochs, same data/backbone across CE and SupCon runs):

| Backbone | Mode | Train Acc | Val Acc | Val Loss |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ResNet-10 | CE | 0.692 | 0.361 | 3.779 |
| ResNet-10 | SupCon | 0.626 | **0.599** | **0.848** |
| ResNet-18 | CE | 0.958 | 0.669 | 1.016 |
| ResNet-18 | SupCon | 0.767 | **0.679** | **0.756** |

**ResNet-10** is the clearest result: CE overfits hard (val accuracy collapses to 0.36 despite 0.69 train accuracy, val loss balloons to 3.78), while SupCon generalizes far better (0.60 val accuracy, 0.85 val loss) despite lower training accuracy. **ResNet-18** has enough capacity that both modes generalize reasonably, but SupCon still edges out CE on validation accuracy and has substantially lower validation loss, being consistent with the contrastive term acting as a regularizer, not just an accuracy booster.

## Project structure

- `datasets/MyDataSet.py` — dataset classes: standard, contrastive (two augmented views per scan), and multi-task
- `models/resnet.py` — 3D ResNet with a dual head: classification logits *and* an L2-normalized 128-dim contrastive embedding
- `models/resnet_org.py` — the original CE-only baseline ResNet, without the contrastive projector head
- `losses/supcon_loss.py` — Supervised Contrastive Loss ([Khosla et al., NeurIPS 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.11362))
- `medicalnet_model.py` — model factory, MedicalNet pretrained weight loading, param group splitting
- `train.py` — training loop (CE and/or SupCon, depending on `--contrastive`)
- `test.py` — evaluation: per-class accuracy, AUC, precision, recall
- `plot.py` — generates the comparison / ROC / confusion-matrix / training-curve figures above
- `bin/ce/`, `bin/contrastive/` — SLURM job scripts (smoke test, test, train) for each mode, both backbones

## Data format

Images are `.npz` files with key `"image_mr"` (3D float array, shape `(D, H, W)`). Labels come from a JSON manifest:

```json
[{"id": "001", "label": "Normal Cognition"}, ...]
```

Label mapping: `"Alzheimer's Disease" → 0`, `"Mild Cognitive Impairment" → 1`, `"Normal Cognition" → 2`.

> The raw ADNI JSON uses `"Dementia"` instead of `"Alzheimer's Disease"` — `MyDataSet.py` already handles this mapping.

## Reproducing the CE vs. SupCon comparison

**Standard cross-entropy:**

```bash
python train.py \
  --train_json <path> --train_image_dir <path> \
  --valid_json <path> --valid_image_dir <path> \
  --backbone resnet --model_name resnet10 \
  --lr 1e-4 --batch_size 8 --epochs 100
```

**Supervised contrastive:**

```bash
python train.py \
  --train_json <path> --train_image_dir <path> \
  --valid_json <path> --valid_image_dir <path> \
  --backbone resnet --model_name resnet10 \
  --lr 1e-4 --batch_size 8 --epochs 100 \
  --contrastive --lambda_con 0.5 --temperature 0.1
```

With `--contrastive`, `ContrastiveDataset` returns two augmented views per scan and `SupConLoss` is added alongside cross-entropy — this costs roughly **3x the forward-pass compute per epoch** compared to CE.

**With MedicalNet pretrained weights (recommended):**

```bash
python train.py ... --checkpoint_pretrain /home/lukeconran/alzheimers/MedicalNet_pytorch_files2/pretrain/resnet_10.pth
```

When used, the backbone trains at `--lr` and the classification head trains at `--lr * 100`.

**Resuming a timed-out job:**

```bash
python train.py ... --resume /home/lukeconran/alzheimers/results/ce/model_resnet10_bs8_epoch_20.pth --epochs 30
```

**End-to-end reproduction of the comparison above:** run `bin/ce/train_resnet10.slurm` and `bin/contrastive/train_resnet10.slurm` (and the `resnet18` variants) in parallel, evaluate each with `test.py` for per-class accuracy/AUC/precision/recall, then run `plot.py` to regenerate the figures in `figures/`.

## MRI-safe augmentations

Applied only during contrastive training, in `ContrastiveDataset._augment()`:
- Random axis flips (50% per axis)
- Additive Gaussian noise (σ = 0.05)
- Intensity scaling (0.9–1.1×)

## Limitations

- **SimCLR is not viable with ADNI alone.** As explained above, self-supervised pretraining needs an unlabeled pool to be worth anything, and ADNI is fully labeled — there's nothing to pretrain on without pulling in a separate corpus (e.g. UK Biobank).
- `medicalnet_model.py` imports `swintransformer` and `resnet_20_head`, which have no corresponding files in `models/` — this raises an `ImportError` on import even if those code paths aren't used. Avoid `generate_model_swin()` and `model_name='resnet50_atrophy'` until resolved.
